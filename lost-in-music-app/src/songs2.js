Not necessarily the best love song (though it is damn close), but the one that covers the most ground, touching on everything from the chemical rush of the initial crush to the rosy honeymoon phases to the shipwrecked aftermath of losing someone dear, all on top of the dreamiest, most unabashedly elated instrumental in pop music.

    "Comments": "I've been floating around the idea of making a Top 100 Favorite Songs list for as long as I've been on RYM (since 2017), and on every single wildly varying iteration I came up with, this was ALWAYS #1, as if it were as obvious a truth in my mind as oxygen. / The one-sentence blurb is that it's a gentle breeze of a song with a devastating hurricane of a lyric, easily taking the crown as the best song in the \"happy sound/sad lyric\" canon. But even if I completely tuned out these phenomenal lyrics, I would still adore how much this song perfected the soft rock sound, creating such a dreamy and ethereal atmosphere with nothing but the typical rock band setup. I would still adore how Stevie Nicks sounds like an angel trying her best not to cut a bitch (even without processing the lyrics, you can still sense the tremors). I would still adore how the band members seem similarly at ease while also threatening to burst at any moment. Those cymbal crashes, especially, are like ocean waves crashing on a California beach. / I would still adore how like the oceans (spilled oil and plastic aside), every note, every second of this song just feels so natural. It all just flows together effortlessly like it was always meant to be that way, despite being infamously borne from strife. No other song has the pieces fit quite this flawlessly. No doubt, Fleetwood Mac's \"Dreams\" is my favorite song of all time",

    "Comments": "For a song that very distantly predates the point in my life when I finally got into music, I'm really surprised that I still haven't found another song that captures the same particular magical dream world this one does. Any time I see this song, I think \"No way this is my #2 favorite song ever, the nostalgia isn't that strong,\" but then I listen to it at any mood, at any time of day, and I'm teleported to a different place entirely. And as someone who's gotten increasingly less nostalgic about the past for a variety of reasons, it's incredible how this has aged so well that for three and a half minutes, I'm reminded of the brighter side of nostalgia and what makes it so valuable in the first place. For some of my favorite songs, I've mentioned how they can sometimes conjure a picture show of memories in my mind. Well, if \"Thinking of a Place\" is for road trip and adventure-related memories and \"Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe in You\" is for all the beautiful and precious things I've seen (especially in nature), then \"Lights\" is for all the people I cherish the most, all the places I would visit annually for holidays, and all the formative events that occurred there or in auditoriums I would visit for one golden occasion and then never again.

    "Comments": "A wrinkled canvas cluttered with brushstrokes of Lenker’s imagination, conjuring hard pastel drawings ranging from the stark (\"empty horses\", \"last human teachers\") to the vibrant and colorful (\"pale green tree\", \"river of light\"), with a chorus reminiscent of \"Jesus, etc.\" in its celebration of human connection and finding shoulders to lean on even as the world crumbles. Meanwhile, the rest of the band anchors the dream world to something more tactile with their crisp, hypnotic, well-measured performances; this song courses through two phenomenal guitar solos like they're NOTHING, it's insane. A high watermark for folk music (and imagination in general) with very few competitors this decade. And I have no doubt that it’s the best song that casually talks about building an energy shield in your room. / P.S. As of writing, YouTube’s top comment for this song concisely describes it as “the hardest-going softest song ever.” You know the one other song I’d also describe that way? “Dreams” by Fleetwood Mac. / P.P.S.

    "Comments": "They often say the journey is better than the destination, but if it's not a one-way trip (and it's not, like, the Trojan War or something) and you're able to take a train or something close enough, the journey BACK is a huge treat. It's a bittersweet, yet relaxing and celebratory time, looking out the window and revisiting all the people and places on your journey, reflecting on everything that got you to this moment. Metheny has become my favorite post-'70s jazz artist because of his ability to capture the more precious sentiments of life like these without words, and in such a soothing way that's both spotlessly slick and world-weary at the same time. A song that could work as a credits roll to the Weather Channel as well as a genuinely profound journey / P.S. Also, he loves trains, which are awesome, so bonus points for that / P.P.S. I haven't seen *that show* this song is often associated with yet (full disclosure: I discovered this song and thus Metheny in general from the Smooth Jazz charts, back when this was still tagged Smooth Jazz), though at this point I don't know if I ever will because it will ruin this song in my mind /// New version on 2023-08-26: The best encapsulation of \"looking out the train window and thinking about stuff,\" enhanced by this feeling that you just finished a very long and tiring, yet fulfilling journey. Bittersweet, yet relaxing and ultimately a celebration of what you've accomplished, all the places you've been, all the people you've met. But this song has a kind of serenity to it that feels hard-fought, like you've just achieved world peace after decades of strife and are now taking a blissful, well-earned rest. Metheny has become my favorite post-'70s jazz artist because of his ability to capture the more precious sentiments of life like these without words, and in such a soothing way that's both spotlessly slick and world-weary at the same time.

I almost just want to say \"Damn, this is raw\" and leave it at that. It's just so devastatingly honest and real that it's almost intimidating, like spilling your heart out to a crowd. But there's a great solace in Fast Car's sincerity, in embracing a less glamorized take on the human condition: the struggle of having ambition and optimism against all odds, of letting old flames burn you out in the end, of the grueling uncertainties latent within slow, incremental success. And all without an outright uplifting message typically found within a pop song, just a mere hint that there maybe could be a way out. This song is nothing but an open heart, pure and honest; it's not heartless to not like it (though I will give you the side eye), but I feel it is heartless to outright hate it, like actively mocking someone at their most honest and vulnerable",

    "Comments": "Of all the trashy club hits from the late 2000s to early 2010s, THIS is the one that has aged the best. There's just an ethereal grandeur, a sense of purity, of absolute truth in this song's wild optimism for just one single night that is unmatched by any other songs of its kind. The closest matchups are perhaps Jay Sean's \"Down\" and Pitbull's \"Give Me Everything\", though even those contain undertones of deep sadness and existential dread (\"down like the economy\" & \"we might not get tomorrow\") that this paean to liberation and love simply isn't shackled by",
    "BM": "From 2:44 onward, when that background synth comes in and starts taking everything to high heaven, all culminating in will.i.am's \"Here we come, here we go\" verse. One of the most truly epic moments in all of pop music, and I'm surprised how anyone can possibly write this off as being a generic club banger when the execution of this powerful, immense buildup is practically peerless",

Forsaken, almost human. He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone.\" I just can't overstate how perfect this passage is",

The more jangly modern artists like Hatchie and Jay Som worship at the altar of this song. There's just a pure chemical rush to this that's actually like lightning in a bottle, like who can blame anyone for trying to recapture this? The \"Tonight, Tonight\" (Smashing Pumpkins) of this type of Shoegaze / Dream Pop + [Blurb] The \"Tonight, Tonight\" (Smashing Pumpkins) of this type of wide-eyed lovesick coming of age Dream Pop, a highly imitable yet unsurpassable lightning in a bottle moment.

There's a rather haunting implication in this song that whatever it IS, it's clearly not as important and relevant to the narrator as what it is NOT, things they wish to contradict away yet can't seem to help but conjure in their mind in arrestingly vivid detail. Adrianne Lenker is such a goddamn poet. Meanwhile, the music contains one of the most compelling rock jams of the past decade. Rock isn't dead, after all",

The passion in Clapton's vocals during the vocal half of this song is unmatchable, and the piano part that makes up most of the song is just plain beautiful",

It's like if you spend most of your musical career doing nothing but trying to make vaguely profound arena rock tunes, you might just eventually strike platinum with something timeless and genuinely touching to the core (also see U2 and their best song, \"One\"). Downright heavenly, from the ethereal production to that perfect piano ostinato. The one time Coldplay actually *did* evoke a sky full of stars (okay, they did so on \"Coloratura\" as well, but this one does it in half the time)",

Meanwhile, the lyrics are admittedly mostly unrelated to anything I just said, but the themes of dizzy infatuation are very well-reflected by the fizzy and dreamlike instrumental, as if the narrator is trying to fill their head with great, rose-filtered memories of this person to stave off any justified doubts they might have about them",

    "Comments": "One of those rare songs that seems to work when you're at your highest and your lowest, kinda like \"Transdermal Celebration\" (even if not sonically the same). I used to think this was a song that celebrated a triumph, but in reality, it's a dangerously open-ended rekindling of hope decorated with glossy sparkles. Sure, it's all rosy and fun, but the song doesn't even end with the two lovers getting back together, just a mere resolution to get back together, no actual indication that it really works out in the end. And yet, in a life where there the waves keep coming, where there is no such thing as a happy or sad ending, just the morning after, it ends up being the most fitting and prescient song I've ever used as a celebration theme.",

    "Comments": "As that one lovely Seneschal review said, there's just a lovely \"cosmic weariness\" and profound longing woven into this existential blanket of a song, always facing a deep spiritual ache no matter what you do to try and distract yourself from it. The fact that it's by a rich woman actually amplifies the melancholy, as if to say that even someone who has the widest possible range of options for happiness still can't escape the itch of existentialism, wandering, and listlessness. That these lyrics were blessed to be accompanied by one of the most richly produced, softest clouds of sounds possible and a vocalist who sings like an Earthen angel almost feels like proof of some hidden force of divinity. This force can at least attempt to be a muse that lets us explore the depths of our hunger, in lieu of being able to satiate it.",

    "Comments": "Sometimes, a guy having the most melodramatic, overexaggerated ego trip of all time can really be just as grand as you'd expect it to be (this is what I just wrote for \"November Rain\"). But man, everything about this hyper-vulnerable soul-searching empty highway anthem just screams \"apex.\" Where does one even go from here after making something like it? That West still maintained such a strong standard of quality for about eight years afterward is impressive. Then the fact he eventually fulfilled the implied prophecy of this song by disappearing up his own ass in one of the worst ways possible, losing himself past the event horizon of Nazism and mired in complete moral darkness and depravity, is just darkly, darkly poetic.

Probably never gonna be the same again. I caught 'em in the mirror, they were holding hands and smiling. Looking younger than they'd been in years.\" I love how the song isn't just about his own nostalgia, but also reflecting on his parents",

    "Comments": "I'm not sure it's possible to get more profoundly miserable than this song. It sounds like it's been mired in a black tar pit of misery and apathy for longer than it can remember, sapped of all convictions such that its only remaining passion is to assemble a bunch of sweaty bodies to climb a staircase to kill God. But yet even the mere act of finding one sweaty body brings great ache to their encumbered, tar-stained bones, so all they can do is dream in vain of a foolish god with his head split open before him... Yeah, this is actually breathtaking and oddly beautiful in its own sick and twisted way",
    "BM": "The resignation in the phrase \"I just don't accept this at all\", both a signal that they desire a change yet know in their bones that they're currently too weakened to enact any such change + The entire \"Arrowheads\" section",

And yet when armed with a powerfully catchy melody, a sugary vocalist with a wonderfully fitting birth name that sounds like the perfect twee pop stage name (\"Celine Autumn\"), and a candy-coated guitar line that just glides through the stereo, you get pop rock perfection. It's like The Cars' \"Just What I Needed\" meets Crying and Kero Kero Bonito + Also wow, loved that I got to see this not one, not two, but THREE times live.",

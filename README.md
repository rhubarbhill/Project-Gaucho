# Project Gaucho
Project Gaucho is an ongoing personal project focused on streamlining music library categorization.

Listening to music is one of my most treasured pastimes/hobbies. For years, I have been keeping a spreadsheet of all the songs in my library including their release dates, languages, genres (based on the genre tree devised by rateyourmusic.com), as well custom descriptors such as "sunny day", "happy", "energetic", etc. The general purpose of this project is to make it easier for me to enjoy my music-listening hobbies, and one way of doing that is by creating programs to make information entry into this spreadsheet quicker and more convenient.

The "Genre Tree Program" allows me to enter a list of genres, and the program will return all of the parent genres of each of the genres. Here is a simple example, visualized:

The "Glamour Extension" is a Chrome extension for the website rateyourmusic.com. In short, it makes clipboard and pencil buttons appear next to song names. When the clipboard button is pressed, it copies the name of the song to the clipboard. In the example below, for the page of Steely Dan's 1980 album "Gaucho", if I press the clipboard button next to "Babylon Sisters," it will copy the track title to the clipboard. This allows for ease of entry into the spreadsheet. There are other features as well (the "clipboard +" button also copies the name of the artist, and the "pencil" button copies even more information including the release year, the language, etc.), but this is the main gist of it.

There are plans for additional programs currently in development.
